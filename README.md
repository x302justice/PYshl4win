# PYoS4win
a micrOS i coded at school while i was bored months ago, decided to put it here

as the name implies, this only works on windows, just like the last script.

a micrOS with iffy functionality at best with some stuff(mostly file explorer)
debug app available by typing /set debug mode true. this brings up a badly made file explorer

dd/mm/yy used for updates

update 2: boot.py file needs to be added because boot animation, or you could remove the boot code line

update 1: how the fuck did i not see those files in there?(compile.py and system_platform_checker removed from the zip file...soon)
