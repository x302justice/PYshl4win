a micrOS i coded at school while i was bored months ago, decided to put it here

as the name implies, this only works on windows, just like the last script.

a micrOS with iffy functionality at best with some stuff(mostly file explorer)
debug app available by typing /set debug mode true. this brings up a badly made file explorer
